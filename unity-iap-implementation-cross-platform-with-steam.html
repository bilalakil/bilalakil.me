<h2>Unity IAP Implementation: Cross-platform with Steam</h2>

<p>Dated: 2021/03/08</p>

<p>
  Here I document the how and, more importantly <em>why</em> of Viking Trickshot's IAP implementation.
  I realised that there were a lot of non-straightforward things impacting the way it was implemented,
  and that I'll probably have no idea why things were done the way they were in a few months time,
  had I not written something like this down.
</p>

<p>
  This isn't a guide as to how IAP should be implemented -
  I definitely didn't take the time during the implementation to make it good enough to be guide-worthy.
  Rather, it's a reference with some documentation.
</p>

<p>
  If you're looking for a guide, I'd suggest reading through 
  <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIAP.html" target="_blank">Unity IAP's manual</a> for iOS and Android, or
  <a href="https://steamworks.github.io/" target="_blank">Steamworks.NET</a> documentation for Steam.
</p>

<p>The document is split into three parts: context; code; and why.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://doodad.games/viking-trickshot" target="_blank">Viking Trickshot</a> has a single in-game purchase for the full game, which is a one-off purchase</li>
  <li>The implementation was made significantly simpler considering there was only a single product being dealt with</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIAP.html" target="_blank">Unity IAP package</a> used for iOS and Android,
    <a href="https://steamworks.github.io/" target="_blank">Steamworks.NET</a> used for Steam
  </li>
  <li>Product represented as a non-consumable in Unity IAP, and DLC in Steam</li>
  <li>The price is displayed in-game
    <ul>
      <li>If a discount is active, both the initial and discounted price will be visible (Steam only)</li>
      <li>Price is displayed with user-local currency for iOS/Android only. A currency disclaimer is shown instead for Steam</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A restore purchases button is usable for iOS only, which includes a "Working..."/"Done!" status indicator</li>
  <li>For unsupported platforms, a link to the game's website is shown</li>
  <li>Some of the files below are prefixed "Kubblammo" instead of "VikingTrickshot". That was the game's old name (RIP)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why were things done this way?</h3>

<h4>Why did I choose DLC for the Steam product, instead of a traditional demo/full-game split?</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The game will have achievements, but a demo in Steam is technically a separate game which means its Steam achievements wouldn't transfer automatically to the full game on purchase, which is undesirable.</li>
  <li>Although not a problem for this game specifically, games relying on Steam's matchmaking features will not feature "cross-play" between the demo and full game (again because the demo is technically a separate game), which is undersirable.</li>
  <li>To minimise development effort, as the DLC approach shares many implementation details with the IAP approach for iOS/Android (which is more normal on those platforms) - it's closer to a one-size-fits-all.</li>
</ul>

<p>Details for the first two points can be found in <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/demos" target="_blank">this Steam document</a>.</p>

<h4>Why do the Unity IAP deferred handlers do nothing?</h4>

<p>A pending state was desired for deferred payments, however some Android-related bugs prevented a straightforward implementation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/73982566#comment50" target="_blank">bug exists in Google Play's billing library</a> wherein deferred purchases that fail never result in Unity's <code>OnPurchaseFailed</code> callback being executed, making it difficult to revert from such a pending state to normal in fail cases (without restarting the app).</li>
  <li>A bug where validated receipts where presenting a <code>GooglePlayReceipt.purchaseState</code> that didn't actually exist in the <code>GooglePurchaseState</code> enum. The enum contained three possible values (none of which were <code>Pending</code>), with integer representations 0, 1 and 2. However, re-opening the app while a transaction was pending resulted in a <code>purchaseState</code> of 4. <a href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/integrate#pending" target="_blank">Google's docs</a> indicate that a pending state is expected to exist.</li>
  <li>If a deferred purchase succeeds, <code>ProcessPurchase</code> is still not executed - instead "Already recorded transaction..." is displayed, thus leaving the last processed version of the transaction in a pending state instead of a purchased state, until the app is restarted. This was the case when I restarted the app in-between triggering the deferred purchase and it succeeding.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of trying to find robust-enough solutions to these problems, I decided it was fine to not have an in-game pending purchase state, considering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pressing the checkout button again while a payment is pending had Google's payment UI show the user that there was in fact a pending payment (at least in test mode - I assume similarly in production). This means it's impossible for a user to be double-charged.</li>
  <li>The primary use case for deferred payments seems to be to enable cash payments (as described in <a href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/integrate#pending" target="_blank">this document</a>). If a user chose the cash payment option themselves, then I'd expect that they'd know the payment is still pending since they haven't actually paid the cash yet, so it's not "random" from their perspective.</li>
  <li>I've spent too much time working on this for now, so I consider a user restarting the app to pick up successful deferred purchases is acceptable.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, I still added a log-only deferred handler, because a null reference exception seemed to be thrown if I didn't.</p>

<h4>Is the security sufficient?</h4>

<p>As far as I can tell, these are the straight-forward-ish methods of abuse with this setup (noting that I'm no security/hacking expert):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Buy, close app, obtain refund, and only open app without an internet connection, or by disallowing usage of the internet by that app.</li>
  <li>Buy, find stored receipt, share with friends who can "put it back in the right place" on their devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regarding the second point, I don't see any straight-forward way of adding device identification to the receipt/stored data for validation.</p>

<p>I'm not too concerned with these abuse methods considering my current position in the indie game world (having not made a dollar yet).</p>

<p>Otherwise, I'm using <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIAPValidatingReceipts.html" target="_blank">Unity IAP's recommended obfuscation approach</a> for encryption keys, and don't think receipts can be spoofed "from nothing" easily, and so think the approach is ok security-wise.</p>

<h4>Other Notes</h4>

<ul>
  <li>I didn't see any way to find an actively discounted price via Unity IAP - hence that feature being Steam only</li>
  <li>I didn't see any simple way to get user-local currency for prices in Steam - hence the disclaimer</li>
  <li>This Steam implementation also notice DLC un-installation (which the user can do themselves anytime) <em>while the game is running</em>, which may not always be desirable</li>
</ul>
